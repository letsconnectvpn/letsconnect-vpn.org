With the ongoing global COVID-19 crisis, many people need to start working from 
home. Typically, the use of a VPN is required to be able to keep working. Let’s 
Connect! provides an open source VPN solution allowing ISPs, hosters and 
businesses to easily [setup](install.html) a secure VPN service.

We are people from the Research and Educational community and under the 
governance of the 
[Commons Conservancy foundation](https://commonsconservancy.org/) founded an 
open source VPN project. Both server-side software as all client software has 
been released under an open source license.

The project is known under two names: Let’s Connect! and 
[eduVPN](https://www.eduvpn.org/). The brand eduVPN is used to promote this 
VPN solution to international educational and research organizations. Our 
progress can be followed on [GitHub](https://github.com/eduvpn) and through the
[Blog](blog/). Our apps can be found on the [Apps](apps.html) page. Please 
[contact](contact.html) us if you want to contribute to, or work with 
Let’s Connect!
