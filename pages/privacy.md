title: Privacy
---

This privacy statement applies to the open source Let’s Connect! VPN software. 
References to 'we', 'our' and 'us' refer to Commons Caretakers b.v., while 
'you' and 'your' refer to the user of Let’s Connect!. The most recent version 
of this privacy policy can always be found at 
[https://letsconnect-vpn.org/privacy.html](https://letsconnect-vpn.org/privacy.html).

### Principles and values

We believe (the opportunity to have) privacy in a secure way is fundamental but 
unfortunately also increasingly scarce. Let's Connect! strengthens the user's 
security by allowing users to deploy Let’s Connect! VPN server and connect to 
this server via the client apps. Let's Connect! has been developed with privacy 
and security in mind since the very beginning of the project because we think 
privacy and security are inseparable within Let's Connect!.

That being said, Let's Connect! software doesn’t log ANY personal data. A user 
may deploy their own server and turn on/off default server logging. We will 
never receive any logging. The eduVPN clients (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, 
Linux) won’t send us ANY personal information. Only when apps crash we might 
get crash logging from for example Google Play or Apple Appstore.

### Be aware

If you connect to a third party Let’s Connect! server that third party may collect personal information of your VPN traffic.
