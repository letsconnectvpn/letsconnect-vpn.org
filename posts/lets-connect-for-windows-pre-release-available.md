Today we are happy to announce the availability of our Letâ€™s Connect! for 
Windows application. Although it is still a pre-release version, it is fully 
functional and ready to be used. After some more usage and testing we aim to 
release the finished app shortly.

You can download the latest version 
[here](https://app.letsconnect-vpn.org/windows/LetsConnectClient_latest.exe). If any 
issues arise, please notify us on [eduvpn@surfnet.nl](mailto:eduvpn@surfnet.nl)
