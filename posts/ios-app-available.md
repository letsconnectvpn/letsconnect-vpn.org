title: iOS app available

The Let’s Connect! VPN apps for Windows, macOS and Android have been available 
for quite a while. It took us more time to release an iOS app. The difficulty 
was we could not use OpenVPN 2.x GPL software because of Apple policies. 
Fortunately, Private Internet Access has created an OpenVPN compatible ‘clone’ 
which we have audited and implemented in the iOS app. The iOS app is available 
in the [Apple Store](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/lets-connect-vpn/id1449261843?mt=8).

It is now a full app, which means that it is not required to use the OpenVPN 
app anymore.
