Today we have good news for macOS users. The Letâ€™s Connect! for macOS 
application is ready to be build and tested. It is still a pre-release version 
and needs to be tested more thoroughly before releasing it to the public. After 
some more usage and testing we aim to release the finished app later in 2018.

The code and build instructions can be found on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/eduvpn/macos/tree/develop).
