We like to announce that the Let’s Connect! project is working together with 
WireGuard.

We are always looking for new ways to improve Let’s Connect! and give our users 
a better experience on the internet. In this light we added WireGuard support 
in the Let’s Connect! server software to our road map. This enables Let's 
Connect! to create WireGuard based clients in the future.
