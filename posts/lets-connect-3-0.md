Let's Connect! 3.0 was released on 25 May 2022. This third major version aims 
to make Let's Connect! even easier to scale to large organizations with a high 
number of concurrent users. 

In particular, it is now possible to use either OpenVPN or WireGuard for 
Let's Connect! connections. As mentioned previously, supporting WireGuard came 
with [challenges](https://www.eduvpn.org/taming-wireguard-in-eduvpn/). This 
specific feature has been made possible thanks to a grant by NORDUnet to The 
Commons Conservancy. 

Among other changes, Let's Connect! 3.0 now supports high availability 
deployments so it is possible to have a fully redundant set-up. 

As new features were added, a lot of attention has been given to simplifying 
the code. The introduction of a new API means that Let's Connect! 3.0 has 
required changes not only to the server side of Let's Connect! but also to the 
clients.

For a full description of what is new in Let's Connect! 3.0, check the
